Introduction
------------

As a member of the arts group, "The Academy" I have centered my blog
posts, podcast assignment, and video assignment around the arts as a
broad topic. I have mostly focused on visual media commenting and
forming opinions on television and film as they relate to and effect the
world today.

Our video focuses on the idea of an actor's, or any performer's, "peak"
of his or her career. This is an idea that we were very interested in,
and upon researching it, discovered there is no one definable peak for
any performer. We delve into our interpretations of what it means to
"peak".
